🚀 System Monitor — C++ Terminal Dashboard

A terminal-based system monitor built in C++ using the ncurses library.
It provides a real-time view of CPU usage, memory consumption, and active processes by reading data from Linux’s /proc filesystem.

🧠 Project Overview

This project recreates the core features of tools like top and htop, but from scratch — to understand how system-level monitoring works internally.
It displays dynamic system statistics inside the terminal with color-coded visuals for better readability.
